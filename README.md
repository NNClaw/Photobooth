# Photobooth
A game/program, where you can make a screenshot of an object and it will save the screenshot on your PC. Overall, a very primitive and simple game/program with a simple code execution.

- Use LMB (*Left mouse button*) to orbit around an object;
- You can use *Mouse Scroll Wheel* to zoom in to object or zoom out;
- There are 3 main buttons on the interface: **Forward**, **Back** and **Screenshot**;
- Use **Forward** or **Back** buttons to navigate through objects (There are 3 objects currently);
- Use **Screenshot** button to take a screenshot of your game. The screenshot will be saved in folder **Output** in the root of a game.
